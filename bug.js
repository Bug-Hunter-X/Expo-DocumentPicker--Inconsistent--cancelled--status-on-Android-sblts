This bug occurs when using the Expo DocumentPicker API on Android.  After selecting a file, the promise returned by `DocumentPicker.getDocumentAsync()` sometimes resolves with a `cancelled` status even though the user successfully selected a file and confirmed their selection in the file picker dialog. This behavior is inconsistent and unpredictable; it may work correctly several times before failing, making debugging difficult.
